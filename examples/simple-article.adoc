As far as I understood, the first paragraph after the main header is the preamble.I'm not sure what a preamble usually contains.Something like an abstract, I guess.I'll have to look that up and read some examples.

== Level 1 Header

This is the first paragraph of the first level 1 section.
I will try out a few things in this section.
For example notes, links and lists.

[[test-anchor]]
=== Level 2 Header

First, I will try out a few things with paragraphs.
Seemingly, paragraphs themselves can have titles.
The following paragraph for example will have a short title.
Let's see how it looks.

.Short Title
This is the second paragraph which should have a small title.
Let's see how that looks once I generate a PDF or an HTML for it.

.Literal Paragraph
I can create literal paragraphs.
That means it will be monospaced and any whitespaces will be kept and not removed.
This can be useful for certain things like ascii art.
The paragraph below is a literal paragraph.

        _   ,_,   _
       / `'=) (='` \
      /.-.-.\ /.-.-.\
      `      "      `

I hope one can see the ascii art above correctly.

.Notes
One can create notes in to variations.

NOTE: This is a note without a title.
I add a bit more text to it to see whether vim properly formats this variation of writing a note.
Unfortunately, vim isn't that smart.
But it doesn't matter.
Asciidoctor-pdf obviously can handle the note even if it isn't formatted perfectly.

.Note Title
NOTE: This is a note with a title.

TIP: This is a tip.

WARNING:  This is a warning.

IMPORTANT: This is important.

CAUTION: Here you need to be cautious.

.Custom Callout
=========================================
This is an example block.
The get numbered automatically.

Even with multiple paragraphs.
Splendid.

.Sidebar
****
This is a sidebar I'm not sure whether it really floats to the side.
To test it, I put text before and after.
****

.Source Code
Below is some source code:

[source,shell]
ps -ef | grep java

I can also create multi-line souce code blocks:

.Multi-Line Source Code Block
[source,javascript]
----
function log(message) {
    console.log(getDateTime() + ": " + message);
}
----

There is autofit configuration that can either be set globally or on specific code blocks.
It shrinks the code such that long code lines may still fit into the PDF.
The code block below has this autofit enabled.
Let's see how it looks.
And to learn more about it, refer to
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/#autowidth-tables.

.Long lined code block
[source%autofit,javascript]
----
function log(message) {
    console.log(getDateTime() + ": " + message); // And some rather long comment which should lead to a shrink.
}
----

=== Icons

This is actually a feature documented at https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/#font-based-icons.
Take a look at it.

Here is a fontawesome icon: icon:comment[].

And here is an icon from another icon set: icon:amazon[set=pf].

You can even set the size of the icons: icon:smile[size=2em]

=== Definitions

The typical definitions look as follows:

.Position Measurement Type
GPS:: Denotes that the position is a GPS position.
CELLULAR:: Denotes that the position is a cellular position.

However, you can also create horizontal definitions.

[horizontal]
.Position Measurement Type
GPS:: Denotes that the position is a GPS position.

CELLULAR:: Denotes that the position is a cellular position.
I'm adding here more text to it to see how the term gets verically aligned.
Nice, the term is top aligned.

=== Q&A

[qanda]
What is the answer to the universe, god and everything?::
The answer is 42.

What time is today?::
I don't know.
Maybe 22:00?

What day is it today?::
It is Sunday 2020-12-13.

=== Tables

There are awesome table features.
You can actually just paste CSV into your document ant it will create a table for it.
So you don't have to wiggle and bring your data into the markdown specific format.
Just awesome.

[cols="^,<,<s,<,>m",options="header",frame="none",grid="rows",format="csv"]
|===========================
ID,FName,LName,Address,Phone 1,Vasya,Pupkin,London,+123 2,X,Y,"A,B",45678
|===========================

=== Lists

* [ ] Todo 1
* [x] Todo 2 (done)

=== Anchors & Cross References

This is a cross-reference to an anchor defined earlier in the document: <<test-anchor,link>>.
