I love the https://www.nordtheme.com[Nord theme].
Unfortunately, I'm terrible at adopting themes.
Nevertheless, I spent a bit of effort to make my documents use the colors of the Nord theme.
The theme is located at link:../../../../themes/nord-theme.yml[themes/nord-theme.yml].

The simplest way to use the theme, is to call the script link:../../../../scripts/create-pdf-with-nord-theme.sh[scripts/create-pdf-with-nord-theme.sh] and pass your AsciiDoc file as argument to it.

[source,shell]
----
./scripts/create-pdf-with-nord-theme.sh your-article.adoc
----

Read xref:scripts.adoc[] and take a look at the source of the script to learn more about the script.
