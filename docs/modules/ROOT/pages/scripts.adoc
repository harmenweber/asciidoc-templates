== `create-pdf-with-nord-theme.sh`

This script executes `asciidoctor-pdf` and passes options so that:

* the xref:themes.adoc#_nord[Nord] theme is used
* the source gets highlighted according to the GitHub style
* the PDF gets optimized

In order to use the script, you need to install the following tools:

* Bash
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/install/[Install asciidoctor-pdf]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/optimize-pdf/#rghost[Install RGhost]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/syntax-highlighting/rouge/#install-rouge[Install Rouge]

You should at least pass one AsciiDoc file as argument.

[source,shell]
----
./create-pdf-with-nord-theme.sh your-article.adoc
----

You can pass multiple AsciiDoc files if you need to generate PDFs for multiple AsciiDoc files.

You can pass options for the `asciidoctor-pdf` executable.
The script will pass them on to the `asciidoctor-pdf` executable.
