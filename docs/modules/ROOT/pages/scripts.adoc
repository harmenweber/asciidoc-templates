== `create-pdf-with-nord-theme.sh`

This script executes `asciidoctor-pdf` and passes options so that:

* the xref:themes.adoc#_nord[Nord] theme is used
* the source gets highlighted according to the GitHub style
* the PDF gets optimized

You should at least pass one AsciiDoc file as argument.

[source,shell]
----
./create-pdf-with-nord-theme.sh your-article.adoc
----

You can pass multiple AsciiDoc files if you need to generate PDFs for multiple AsciiDoc files.

You can pass options for the `asciidoctor-pdf` executable.
The script will pass them on to the `asciidoctor-pdf` executable.
