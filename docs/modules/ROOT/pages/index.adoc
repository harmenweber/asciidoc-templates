This repository holds resources that I use when I write in AsciiDoc.
It includes templates, themes, scripts and whatever else might be handy.

To whoever stumbled upon this repository:
I hope you find something useful for yourself.
Let me know if you have anything to amend, improve or correct.
Let me know if you have any resources of your own that you are willing to share.
